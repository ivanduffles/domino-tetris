# Domino Tetris Setup Status

## Repository readiness

The project source code is present locally and ready for modification.

Current game files detected in the repository root:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`
- `img/` assets folder
- `LICENSE`

## Next step for spec-driven development

When you share the game specification text, we can create a dedicated spec file (for example, `GAME_SPEC.md`) and begin implementing the Domino + Tetris mechanics.
